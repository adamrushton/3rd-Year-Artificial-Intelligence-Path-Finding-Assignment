# Artifical Intelligence Path Finding Assignment
### **Languages:** C++ using TL Engine (The Universityâ€™s game engine)

### **Description:** Path finding from start to goal nodes finding the shortest path using a variety of different algorithms. Breadth first search, A* path finding are used and can be toggled between. Any map size can be loaded into the program and start and end locations can be customisably set. 

### **Programming techniques used/Notes:**
- Fully Object Oriented with the use of Smart Pointers 
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- A* path finding algorithm
- Breadth first search path finding algorithm
- Bezier curve (Smooth turning for the sierra character)
